# vbb-rest

***vbb-rest* is a public transport REST API**, a clean alternative to the [VBB HAFAS API](https://github.com/derhuerst/vbb-hafas). [It has lots of advantages over theirs.](docs/why.md)

**[API documentation](docs/index.md)**

Use [`vbb-client@3`](https://github.com/derhuerst/vbb-client) for querying this API in browsers or with Node.
