# vbb-rest

***vbb-rest* is a public transport REST API**, a clean alternative to the [VBB HAFAS API](https://github.com/derhuerst/vbb-hafas). [It has lots of advantages over their API.](docs/why.md)

*Note*: This version of the API is deprecated. **Please use the [new version at `2.vbb.transport.rest`](https://github.com/derhuerst/vbb-rest/tree/2)** to make sure everything keeps working.

Refer to the [API Documentation](docs/index.md). Use [vbb-client](https://github.com/derhuerst/vbb-client) for querying this API in the Browser or with Node.js.
